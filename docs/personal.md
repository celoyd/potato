# Personal notes on pansharpening

This is a collection of thoughts and feelings that came up while working on pansharpening. I hope it will be interesting to a few other enthusiasts and eccentrics, but it is not part of the technical documentation of the project.

## How big are pictures?

High-resolution satellite images have a way of annoying people. They don’t fit well in everyday categories. The linguist David Zubin [once proposed](https://escholarship.org/content/qt44q4w68s/qt44q4w68s_noSplash_1c9886bb9a4650047662d293c0f8d8aa.pdf?t=nsvvtu) a typology of scales – as experienced, not as measured – that reaches something hard to define, the kind of thing we recognize in dreams. Lightly adapted, the categories are:

- Type A. Objects smaller than us, that we can handle to see (or otherwise sense) from different angles: a kitchen utensil, a pen, an earring, a small animal, our own hands. Things we can envelop with our awareness.

- Type B. Objects usually larger than us, that we cannot freely move, but that we can move _ourselves_ around to look in on from more than one angle: the outside of a house, an elephant, a tree, a pond, a cement mixer, a mountain. Things we can lightly hold with our awareness.

- Type C. Objects as seen or understood from a single place as we look around: a field, a room, the view from a viewpoint. Things that lightly hold our awareness.

- Type D. Objects larger than us, that we may move within or know in other ways, but do not sense in a unitary way (although we may perceive parts as A, B, or C objects): a forest, a town, a sea, the inside of our home, the shoreline of a river. The notes on Zubin’s talk say _there is no perspective_. These are things that envelop our awareness.

This is a typology not of physical objects but of how we think about them, so things in the world move between these categories as easily as we imagine them doing so.

James Lick was an idiosyncratic piano-maker who bought large properties around San Francisco just before the gold rush made them extremely valuable. One of his plans to memorialize himself was a pharaoh-scale marble pyramid at 4th and Market, possibly flanked by colossal statues of his parents. The great geographer George Davidson, according to legend, persuaded Lick that such monuments might be bombarded in a future war, and that a safer legacy would be an observatory. Unlike the pyramid, Lick Observatory is not much to look at: white dots on the horizon hills, doing the looking themselves.

Or that’s what they were to me. This summer, my partner and an old friend and I went to see them. You drive east from San José on avenues, then roads through oak savanna and occasional farms, then switchbacks. The dots turn into eggshell domes. There is parking and a little gift shop and the usual signs that grad students are around. In one dome, like a Zeppelin in its varnished wooden hanger, is a machine that contains the largest precision lens still in regular, general-purpose use.

You can see it as the first artifact, the rubricated incipit, of Big Science, the kind of collaborative, complexly managed, capital-intensive thing that the Manhattan Project, CERN, and the Human Genome Project all are. You can’t touch it – you could; you don’t – but you can take a lap around the dome and see it the way you see a monument. It becomes a type B object within a type C object. In the nearby hallways are old eyepieces and photographic plates that are even Type A objects. They familiarize the giant machine and make it a system you can imagine learning to use.

This was the project around the telescope: to turn the night sky, which is of Type D, into a catalog of large but intelligible type C landscapes. With this machine, E.E. Barnard was the last person to discover a celestial object (Amalthea, a moon of Jupiter) by simply looking – “[just you and your retina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaR9DwmKL18)”. He was also the first to discover a comet (206P/Barnard–Boattini) without looking – by photography alone. As a historical artifact, one of the things this telescope records is a moment in the partial disembodiment of astronomy. Even of seeing more generally, if you put it by Roentgen’s mysterious rays and Muybridge’s floating horse.

Now when I see the white flecks on the horizon they are still dimensionless points but also I remember walking inside an echoing vault. I know them two ways. There is something pleasantly uncanny about this, as there is about a realistic dollhouse. That feeling is not rare if you go looking for it. It’s even around the postcards of Teotihuacán and the Grand Canyon on the fridge. Every camera is a machine for rescaling; a telescope is only an extreme one. And the Earth-observing satellites we’re interested in here are, from an optical engineering point of view, reasonably ordinary large telescopes. They are also involved in a project of representing something infinite as a vast but actually existing collection of gigantic but finite parts.

The images that this project are concerned with shimmer and slip under attention between types A, B, C, and D. They are enumerable collections of manipulable, knowable pixels. They are also immersive photographs of places in so much detail that they cannot be fully understood in human time. A disrespect for scales and categories is common to any kind of representation. But these images are an unusually efficient way to get size-of-things decompression sickness. I think one of the reasons they feel unsettling is that they carry so much of this scale shock.


## Prospects

The geographer Jay Appleton proposed that we esthetically prefer spots in landscapes that balance _prospect_, the opportunity to see, against _refuge_, the opportunity to not be seen. A comfortable place for humans might be a thick grove of trees with good sight-lines over open but interesting surroundings. Maybe some of the appeal of satellite images can be understood in these terms. They have extraordinarily wide prospects – type D worlds packed into type A objects – and the ultimate refuge – never to have been present at the point of view.

This unoccupied perspective is also one of the main things people dislike about satellite images. Where Donna Haraway wants to illustrate the idea of a pseudo-omniscient but actually ungrounded way of seeing in _Situated Knowledges_, she uses the orbital perspective as her metaphor. This stings a bit, for me and for fellow practitioners I’ve discussed it with over the years, because there is truth in it. But Haraway is diagnosing, not condemning. She is asking us to think about how to do better.

A pedestrian way forward is to think about the details of how remote sensing works. I am trying to help here in small, technical ways. I don’t think that talking about how sensor arrays are laid out is at the nexus of the problem, but I think it could loosen some loops. People who think about these things should have a sense of the physical object that is in fact at the point that we rhetorically call empty. A more sophisticated way forward is the “para-empiricism” of Laura Kurgan, who uses methods like remote sensing to seriously investigate external reality while demonstrating the impossibility of capturing it. In _Close Up at a Distance_, she writes:

> Data are always collected for a specific purpose, by a combination of people, technology, money, commerce, and government. The phrase “data visualization”, in that sense, is a bit redundant: data are already a visualization.

> My claim is not that this plunges us into some abyss of uncertainty, though, or makes it impossible to function in the real world. On the contrary, it is only on the condition of accepting this condition of data, in _para_-empirical condition, that we have any chance of operating responsibly in or on the world.

I imagine that anyone who has done data work knows the feeling of being downstream of people who supply what you think of as the raw data, and at the same time upstream of others who think of what you supply as the raw data. We’re all in the anabranches and braid-bars of these flows. We cannot do good work without understanding where we are. I am not in the same place as Haraway or as Kurgan; I have little to contribute by way of essays or art installations. If I can get something to stick it may only be some little ideas about color conversion. Even these must start from seeing color conversion as a question with more than one answer, so that, as Kurgan writes, “we admit that our data are not the same as reality”. I am not doing the kind of deep conceptual work that she is talking about but her ideas help me.

People have occasionally asked me whether satellite image mosaics are maps or photos. I don’t think there’s a useful answer to this. A map I guess is some kind of diagram, a generalization of lives, a mixture of a drawing and a story, an interpretation from the space of a Type D planet to the space of a Type A or B page or app. Image mosaics might be that. Photographs are, what, faithful records of visible light at a moment? But only under big assumptions. Film photos are abstruse chemical reactions many steps removed from light, often [manipulated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoCtni-WWVs#t=2m30s), and their relationship to time is [nontrivial](https://www.connolly-cleary.com/HALLofMIRRORS/LOOK.html). The computational photography pipelines in phones these days are now almost as complicated in their own ways. Image mosaics are – diagrams made from photos? I don’t know. I don’t think we can learn much from insisting on their categorical relationship to the idea of a map or to that of a snapshot.

I default my maps to imagery. I often think of an argument that [Robert Simmon](https://robertsimmon.com/) has made across essays and talks: that the best way to show something is often to show it. Complex visualization techniques (diagrammatic views, false color, and so on) are particular solutions to special problems. If the task is simply to see something clearly, well, what does it look like? Our minds and our visual systems have a million generations of co-adaptation. We’re good at picking out the general patterns and the key details in things seen in the “normal” way, where red means red, green means green, and blue means blue. Defaulting to true color has served me well. If I want to see Sagrada Família without actually going to Barcelona, I’m looking for a photo before I’m looking for a blueprint. I use street maps when I need to navigate on streets but I don’t want to live the main of my life, to know my world, with every shape polygonized and every color painted over.

One of the classic dialectics in geography is between a feature view and a field view. In the world of features, what can be known are points and crisp-edged shapes. You’re inside or outside. But in the world of fields, everything is continuous: attributes can be measured at points or aggregated within shapes, but they never really go from A to B without passing through something intermediate. The feature interpretation has mostly won. It certainly has some merit. And discretized geospatial objects are a snug fit with the kind of database architectures and legal frameworks that have also won.

“Raster is faster but vector is correcter” is a cheeky slogan of the feature view. They mean that fields sampled in grids – images – can be used as computationally convenient representations of reality, to draw on screens for example, but that these are mere imprints of something more properly, more primarily, represented as objects. To me this is backward or at least sideways. For me, existence precedes essence, and the clean-ness of those sharp lines is only convenienter. What we get from the world is samples. What our senses give us are much more like pictures than like political maps. It is not devaluing vectors to say that creating them is interpretive work.

## The conversation

For a decade or so, you’ve been able to do numbers on LinkedIn by posting that satellite data in itself is irrelevant to most customers: that what they really want are not the pixels but the actionable insights derived from those pixels. This annoys me. It’s the [no take, only throw](https://cupcakelogic.tumblr.com/post/124392369931/she-is-still-learning) of data strategies: no ask, only answer. From the fact that people care about what’s useful to them, it does not at all follow that the details of their questions, and the sources of their answers, are unimportant. As hard as we may try to encapsulate the work of applying particular methods on particular datasets, the process of understanding the world is irreducibly connected to the details of the world. Reality is very specific.

This is where the idea of imagery as a commodity runs into trouble. A commodity is fungible. As a buyer of grade 1 red lentils or grade C10100 electronic copper, I expect the next ton I order to be materially the same as the last one; if I learn it isn’t, I won’t buy it. As a buyer of satellite imagery, I expect the next image I order to be materially different from the last one; if I learn it isn’t, I won’t buy it. Satellite imagery is much more like news than it is like beans. It’s useful insofar as it carries the imprints of chunks of reality, and those don’t funge. As I once had the pleasure of hearing the semi-legendary imagery product manager Camilla Mahon explain to an exec with more MBAs than sense, people care about what’s in the pictures.

I spent most of a decade on a team making and maintaining an imagery basemap. (This is why people occasionally ask me what such mosaics _really are_.) A basemap should be beautiful enough to be the foreground but calm enough to be the background – self-consistent but taking advantage of every useful data source – specific and recent but also generalized and timeless. There’s a freedom wherever perfection is clearly unreachable. Satellite imagery got sharper during my time at that job, but its processing was clearly jammed at local maxima. Even the best data had a freezer-burned look that was easy to spot and hard to fix. It was the pansharpening. This was one of three or four upstream problems that we couldn’t realistically correct as buyers and reprocessors of imagery. It chafed a little for a long time.

(I got that job mainly by developing an approach to pixel-sorting for removing clouds and seams from stacks of MODIS images. That was a way to make [more beautiful low-resolution composites](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-03/a-satellite-map-capable-of-erasing-all-the-world-s-clouds). With Potato, I feel as if I’m back where I came in. Here I am again as an independent researcher with a strange opinion that we’re all doing niche aspects of image processing for remote sensing in a slightly wrong way. It’s my [two nickels](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dr-doofenshmirtz-if-i-had-a-nickel).)

When a friend asked about some artifacts in the Pléiades Neo sample images, in mid-2021, I rudely replied with an outline of everything I knew about pansharpening as a problem, and [posted it](https://gist.github.com/celoyd/5bb5417b24801e0446ad5977cc3581e4). It was mostly read by very polite friends, which is a tolerable fate. I hoped it might influence the field a bit, by encouraging novices to get interested and experts to lay off certain bad habits. If that happened, it hasn’t gotten back to me. To tinker with and care about a niche topic while trying to follow its field is to end up full of thorny opinions that almost no one cares about. This is such a pointlessly unpleasant feeling that it’s best to learn to see the humor in it.

Here’s my imaginary LinkedIn post where I set the world to rights on pansharpening, and it’s even a two-parter:

1. Actual pansharpening, the stuff we see when we buy from a satellite company or use a map app, has not improved much in 15–20 years. The product as a whole _has_: compared to its equivalent in 2004, the average image today is off a more precise sensor, its terrain and atmospheric correction is more accurate, and its color grading is more pleasing. But its pansharpening is perhaps [one JND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference) better. So images from 20 years ago tend to be hazy and poorly color-balanced by our standards, and there are some tangentially pansharpening-related problems to do with [spectral response](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-IKONOS-spectral-response-b-SPOT-5-spectral-response-c-LANDSAT-ETM-spectral_fig1_220051314) (at the beginning of the image chain) and intense JPEG compression (at the end). But the pansharpening artifacts in them, the poorly rendered hue details, are not much worse than what you see today. Industry found a local maximum with the Graham–Schmidt and Zhang (UNB) cluster of local statistical methods during the heyday of Gorillaz and the Motorola RAZR and has never left it.

2. Pansharpening research, the stuff in preprint archives and in journals under that keyword, is mostly irrelevant to pansharpening. The median paper describes a deep learning network architecture for image fusion, implies a simplified model of pansharpening as an example problem, and shows some benchmarks on that toy task. The code, if public, is messy, cryptic, and unportable to the point of requiring acroamatic knowledge. There is no principled explanation of the model’s design, only a suggestion that it works better than alternatives, nor any critical evaluation of its outputs, only scalar metrics. Neither details nor big ideas are explored. I’m talking here about the median paper; there are also some that contribute much more (for example, [Ciotola et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08334)), but they arrive only rarely. Mostly we get papers showing that some massive O(<var>n</var>²) model benchmarks a little better than the last one on a version of pansharpening so simplified that it implies very little about anything. “We beat Smith et al. by 0.3 PSNR, on different data, under unexamined assumptions, without full reproducibility, using a design we can describe but not explain” doesn’t do much for the field.

The choices behind Potato come out of this sense that the field has bifurcated into an Actual Work Done Poorly camp, in industry, and an Imaginary Work Done Well camp, in research. There’s an old legend about a developer who goes through a tech company’s interview process, gets hired onto a product team, immediately fixes one particular bug, and quits before lunch on their first day. It was the only option after getting no response to a bug report they’d submitted as a user. That’s roughly my attitude with this project. If this works, soon I’ll see more beautiful images of my homeworld when I use [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)’s traceable imagery layers, Apple Maps, Google Earth, and so on. If someone wants to hire me to implement it, good: this repo is after all only noncommercially licensed, and I enjoy and am fairly good at this kind of work. But the broader goal is that I can stop seeing these formaldehyde-preserved–looking images everywhere. I think we are close to a little renaissance in this niche but nontrivial topic, and I am trying to do my part to bring it about.

## Earth’s human shell

The main part of this project states some technical theses about pansharpening: that interpolating spectral power distributions is the right way to derive color, for example. In this more subjective corner, I make a more subjective claim: pansharpening should make satellite images a little bit more like ordinary photographs.

In my notebooks are sloppy tables, made while cooking and on BART rides, where I’ve tried to articulate something that I didn’t have a proper name for – perhaps I haven’t read enough J.J. Gibson – until I read [Fleischmann and Arribas-Bel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971524000760)’s aspatial/spatial imagery distinction. Samples of the division:

| Ordinary snapshots | Geospatial images |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Bayer demosaicking | Pansharpening |
| Views from inside buildings, landscapes, and the planetary boundary layer, of things within them | Views from outside buildings, landscapes, and the planetary boundary layer, of them |
| Camera metadata | Spacetime metadata |
| Not part of systematic repeat observations | One point in a time series |
| Collected reactively, to record vision: prosthesis for memory | Collected proactively, to extend vision: substitution for memory |
| Distance and per-object projection varies wildly | Nearly orthographic perspective; everything is in the perspectival far field and usually functionally equidistant |
| Generally unknown POV that might be recovered from known points in the image | Continuous fabric of landscape and POV that can be co-refined to make both known |
| Uncalibrated R, G, B bands with unknown lighting | Calibrated multispectral bands lit by sunlight through the atmosphere |
| Mostly 3D space, with strong 2D influences (up/down is more limited than east/west or north/south) – on the bottom of the tidepool | Mostly 2D space, though wrinkled, folded, and foamed (u/d flattened; e/w and n/s rarely obvious) – looking into the tidepool |
| Typically processed to approximate a sense of being embodied at the camera’s perspective | Typically processed to be understood abstractly, as a kind of chart |
| Things meant to be seen: deliberate communication, even if indirectly (signs, faces, conventionally structured and painted things) | The back of the tapestry: the non-signaling consequences of life (biomes, zoning, the routes of highways) |

I am trying, and failing so far, to learn to make sense to myself when I talk about how imagery looks. Some of this is about philosophical and technical distinctions that confuse me with their slippery nuance. But I have come to suspect that, alongside the subtle reasons, a serious problem is an aspect of media theory and optical engineering understood by toddlers: that faraway things look small. And, relatedly, that we live sideways.

The daily environment, for most of us, is heavily designed for interpretation. We’re surrounded by things that say things – signs, labels, buttons, lane markings, railings, photos, rumble strips, PA announcements, movies, knurls, notifications, maps, truncated-dome bump pads, graphic tees, apps, music, arrows, and especially words on screens and pages. There are even some that try to get things across without permission, for example disinformation, the Gruen transfer, and advertising generally. All these symbols are spatially bound, and to evade them (when they are malign, or just for a break) we make spatial changes. We travel to another culture or to nature. We zoom in on something too small and unconsidered to be overloaded with external meaning. Or we zoom out. And this is one of the things about satellite imagery that makes it _like that_: it’s ad-free.

This can only be mostly true. Even in a narrow sense, there are some stadia with logos on their roofs, for example. In a middle sense, any castle or mansion or skyscraper is a kind of advertisement. In a very broad sense, anything made by people with theory of mind will show some sort of intention about communication, even if unconscious, even if self-directed, even if the idea is to hide. However we distribute interpretive weight here, I think I can keep most readers on board by saying, vaguely, that there are classes of deliberately communicative artifacts that tend to wash out of the visible environment as it changes scale. 

But it’s not just scale – it’s angle too. Almost all human life happens in the atmosphere’s [surface layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer), its bottom 100 meters or so. A few people are in space, some are diving or flying, and some are underground or on the upper floors of skyscrapers, but almost all of us, almost all of the time, can visibly wave to someone on the planet’s surface if we’re near a window. Compared to the size of the planet, this human shell is barely there. It is proportionally thinner than the film of a floating soap bubble. Compared to the size of everyday experience – the hills in the distance, the walk to the store, the bus to work – it’s still fairly thin. We move and look side to side much more than up and down. We perceive a spatially 3D world, but at communal scales we’ve organized it mostly as a collection of ground-like surfaces, parallel to the ground, near the ground.

Satellite images look down, and much has been made of the sense of dominion that can allow, and rightly so. But down has other meanings too. In terms of how the built environment is organized, down is from the side. Almost all the world’s symbols, the beneficially explanatory signs and the parasitically distracting advertisements, the façades and architectural presences, and the barriers of walls and fences, face the horizon. This is the co-fact of our everyday motion and vision running mostly to the sides: things meant to catch vision or prevent motion run mostly up and down.

So the view from above has a way of looking through large projects, seeing intent instead of being told it. It’s a cutaway view without cutting. It doesn’t see inside buildings but it sees into things almost as hidden and much bigger: mines and feedlots, aggregate textures of neighborhoods, ancient ruins and paths, slow shifts in land use, the tracks of long-distance transmission lines, palace grounds, forests or their remains – things you can’t see clearly from the inside. It’s like the dual of an MRI; it’s a view _so exterior_ that it gives outlines to things we cannot recognize or diagnose while standing next to them.


## The big things

Satellite imagery is oblivious of human experience inside buildings and homes. It sees the feedlots, but the work and the environments of people who do things the size of a body or smaller – artists, plumbers, sweatshop workers, cooks, teachers and students, receptionists, clerks, nurses and doctors, waiters, image processing programmers, custodians and cleaners, librarians, and to be blunt _specifically women_ in many societies – are mostly unseen by satellites. The effect of their work is visible everywhere in 30 cm images from space, if you know how to read the world, but its material presence is not resolved. Satellites mainly see big outdoor things. _Human_ big outdoor things are generally paid into being by very powerful people. There’s crucial space around that “mainly” and that “generally” but the pattern is important.

When I contributed stories in satellite imagery to a corporate Instagram account, I was often bumping into the way that interesting and newsworthy changes to Earth’s surface tend to be the worst day of someone’s life. You will get a lot of clicks on a post showing the giant fissures that an earthquake left in a field. But (in among many other ways to look at it) we are often working in the potential partial presence of billions of others. We may look over their shoulders without even thinking about it, and they may show up in the comments asking why there is a breezy, isn’t-geoscience-cool caption under a picture of the thing that just killed their spouse.

I care about satellite imagery for many of the same reasons I ask people to be wary of it. Because it’s good at showing the works of the powerful and the effects of disasters, it can lead to an unknowingly cynical way of looking at the world: an attitude that thinks it’s _realistic_ but can only see wealth and suffering. Taken with more thought and care, these images become, and always were, things that civil society needs. “Civil society” is stilted. I mean things that _we_, you and I, need. I often think of the people of Kathmandu Living Labs, who, after the 2015 earthquake, immediately [organized themselves into an information bridge](https://web.archive.org/web/20150526003126/http://nepalitimes.com/article/nation/data-mapping-the-aftermath-of-earthquake,2218) that got crowdsourced, satellite-based prioritization and routing to rescue workers. Those maps and their labels – earthquake damage, people trapped, blocked roads, shelter area, help wanted, distribution area, relief – still make me tear up.

I live on the Hayward Fault. People I care about are distributed along other faults, in forests overdue to burn, on floodplains, around active volcanoes, and where typhoons and hurricanes land. In the long view, the diagrammatic view, we’re all going to take our turns as the ones whom the food and water, the search and rescue crews, or the firefighters are trying to get to. Their dispatchers will be piecing together a composite view of where the worst problems are and which routes are passable. I want them to have clear overview images from that morning as a primary reference. I have reservations about ways of making the world legible to distant power. I have also seen that many things in the world turn out to work well for horizontal, distributed care at scale (in [Deb Chachra’s sense](https://comment.org/care-at-scale/)) if we actually use them that way.

Potato is trained entirely on imagery from the Maxar Open Data Program, which is released under the CC BY-NC license with the intent that it be useful for disaster response. Beyond complying with the terms of the license, I have tried to do right by this purpose. One reason for Potato’s small size is to make it (or, really, others’ projects that it might influence) useful for the time- and resource-constrained work that disasters require. There should be reliable, detail-resolving pansharpeners that run on first responders’ crappy laptops – not only high-end compute clusters – when circumstances require.

But I don’t just care about satellite imagery: I like it. I enjoy it. And yes yes I mean a sort of elevated joy, a serious and numinous joy, a mind- and heart-expanding perception of uncountable life and horizonless complexity that visibly surrounds us. Let’s take that as read. But more than that: a simple lazy joy. It’s the Saturday morning with a coffee Landsat session and the Sunday night with a beer Google Earth session, not in service of anything noble, not accomplishing moral work, just looking at pictures of places the way people watch TV or eat pistachios on the hill in the park. Ordinary enjoyment is one of the main things that keeps me coming back to this project and others like it. When I see processing shortcomings, I want to fix them not just out of professional commitment or whatever but in a purely selfish way: so I can pan around Alaskan swamps without thinking “Hmm, the chlorophyll in the water is leading to weird gradients. This is why you have to account for the IR bias of the pan band.” – I just want to see the swamp and eat my pistachios.

Snapshots again. Some virtues of snapshots can only belong to them. But because snapshots as a practice have been so widely and lovingly cultivated by a century of free experimentation and design iteration, they are palpably the best kind of image in certain ways. I want their immediacy. I want their way of meeting visual perception halfway. That should inform and inspire pansharpening. It’s not quite that I want to steer satellite images toward phonecam or 35mm or DSLR photos. (This is an implicit goal of some pansharpening work based uncritically on ideas about web-scraped snapshot datasets.) No, I want to encourage us to move in parallel, in some dimensions, toward broadly similar goals of clarity.

Any way of making images should leave traces of its methods. I take this from Haraway and Kurgan but also from engineering principles. An image with no visible noise or errors – no Airy disks, no shot noise – is an undersampled image. The slight demosaicking artifacts (and chromatic aberration, camera shake, and imperfect focus) in well-processed snapshots are not intrusions on the images, only on the illusion of the images as apodictic, open windows onto reality. A film photo is allowed film grain and an audio recording is allowed a noise floor. We can clean out many artifacts but eventually scrubbing becomes scraping, and we have to let the remaining ones belong. When we make pansharpened images, then, we should be trying to make well-pansharpened images, not images that pretend not to have been pansharpened.

Earth is beautiful beyond beauty and should be shown that way as we are able. To try to _make_ Earth beautiful the way a real estate agent photographs a McMansion would not work. We have to be working toward some kind of transparency while accepting we will never arrive at it. Earth’s surface is overwhelmingly wholesome and yet it is also, in places, miserable, worrying, and threatening. Like anything else that is, in a broad sense, alive, it resists being summarized or translated. It’s not a message. The notes on Zubin’s talk say _there is no perspective_.
