## Data

I am very grateful to Maxar for distributing its [Open Data Program](https://registry.opendata.aws/maxar-open-data/) imagery on a CC BY-NC license. There’s the legal denotation of the license, but there’s also an ethical connotation to the data, which I have worked to take seriously. The imagery is given away to alleviate disasters, and therefore, among other goals, Ripple aims to introduce techniques that may be useful to people trying to make maximally interpretable imagery in the time- and resource-constrained operating environments of disaster response. That’s also why this project is CC NY-BY: to follow the example set by the data it used.

I encourage anyone using the Open Data Program to treat it with great care. It’s not just another sample dataset. All of us will be in serious disasters if we live long enough. None of us wants to see their neighborhood on the worst day in its history labeled “Figure 4. Typical offset artifacts.” Don’t do that to anyone.

## Ideas

Conversations with many people have contributed indirectly to this project. In particular, Stephan Hügel and Robert Simmon asked good questions, and most of all, Peter Richardson was full of creative and useful ideas at a key moment when this was shaping up. Remaining errors are mine alone.
