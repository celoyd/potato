# Documentation

This is the index of Potato’s documentation. The advanced reader will find fine-grained technical documentation in code comments.

In the documentation I often use the didactic first person plural: “_we_ do this or that”. If you find this annoying, please imagine that I mean my gut microbiome and I.
