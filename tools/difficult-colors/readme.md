# Difficult colors

This is the hard negative system for Potato. A hard negative is (loosely speaking) when you find something a model does badly and feed more of it into the training data. In this case it’s specific reflectance profiles that Potato struggles with. These are often very saturated colors, like deep blues and reds, or artificial greens (which are presumably confusing for a model that sees a _lot_ of natural greens).

This is a fairly informal, ad-hoc process in Potato.
